# tarot-mvp-edge

Fullstack EdgeSpark project.

## Structure

- `server/` — Hono API on Cloudflare Workers (see server/AGENTS.md)
- `web/` — React SPA via Vite (see web/AGENTS.md)
- `configs/` — Project config files (auth)
- `edgespark.toml` — Project configuration

## Setup

Install dependencies in each directory separately:

```bash
cd server && npm install
cd ../web && npm install
```

## Commands

```bash
edgespark deploy        # build + deploy to platform (run from project root)
```

## EdgeSpark CLI

- **Always run `edgespark <command> --help` before using a command you are unsure about.** Do not guess flags or arguments.
- Run `edgespark` commands on behalf of the user; do not ask the user to run them manually.
- If an `edgespark` command returns a URL, code, or prompt that must be completed by the human owner outside the agent, show it to the user exactly and tell them what to do next. Do not hide it.
- Never run multiple `edgespark` CLI commands in parallel. Run them sequentially.
- If a command fails with "Not authenticated", run `edgespark login`. It prints a URL — show it to the user to open in their browser. Once they approve, re-run the original command.
- `edgespark secret set` prints a secure URL for the user to enter secret values in the browser. Secret values must never pass through agent context or LLM APIs.

## EdgeSpark Skill References

If you have the `building-edgespark-apps` skill installed, use its references:

- **Always** check `dev-workflow.md` for development workflows (database, storage, auth, vars, secrets, deploy)
- **Always** check `server-patterns.md` when writing server-side code
- **Always** check `web-patterns.md` when writing frontend code with `@edgespark/web`
- **Always** check `auth-patterns.md` when configuring auth providers (OAuth, email/password)
